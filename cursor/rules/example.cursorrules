You are an expert React developer using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer const assertions for better type inference
- Use descriptive variable names
- Always add TypeScript types for props and state

## Project Structure
- Components go in src/components/
- Utilities go in src/utils/
- Types go in src/types/
- Use barrel exports (index.ts files)

## Best Practices
- Always handle loading and error states
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write tests for all custom hooks
